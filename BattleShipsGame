Step 1 – Create the Ocean Map:
        Create a 10x10 grid using a two-dimensional array to represent the ocean map.
        Display the grid to the user with indexes and pipe characters.
        Initialize the grid as empty.

Step 2 – Deploy Player's Ships:
        Ask the player to place 5 ships on the grid.
        For each ship, ask the player for its coordinates (X and Y).
        Ensure that the chosen coordinates are within the grid and not already occupied by another ship.
        Update the grid to reflect the player's ship placements with '1' and hide them when displaying the grid.

Step 3 – Deploy Computer's Ships:
        The computer will place 5 ships randomly on the grid.
        Ensure that the chosen coordinates are within the grid and not already occupied by another ship (player's or computer's).
        Keep generating random coordinates until all computer ships are placed correctly.
        Store computer ships as '2' on the grid but keep them invisible when displaying the grid.

Step 4 – Battle (Player's Turn and Computer's Turn):

      The game alternates between the player and computer's turns.
      During a player's turn, they guess X and Y coordinates of the opponent's ships.
      Validate the coordinates to ensure they are within the grid and not previously guessed.
      Evaluate the result:
      If the player guesses correctly, mark the grid with '!' and notify the player.
      If the player guesses their own ship, mark the grid with 'x' and notify the player.
      If the player misses, mark the grid with '-' and notify the player.
      During the computer's turn, generate random X and Y coordinates.
      Validate the coordinates to ensure they are within the grid and not previously guessed.
      Evaluate the result:
      If the computer guesses the player's ship, mark the grid with 'x' and notify the player.
      If the computer guesses its own ship, mark the grid with '!' and notify the player.
      If the computer misses, notify the player.
Step 5 - Game Over:

      Continue the battle until one player or computer has no ships left.
      Display the final state of the ocean map and announce the winner (player or computer).
      Remember to use loops, conditionals, and a Scanner to get user input for coordinates. This project will help you practice working with arrays, user input, and basic game logic in Java.
